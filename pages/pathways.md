# Explore the Learning Pathways

The **learning pathways** approach blends selected topics from the systematically organized workbooks, transforming individual knowledge chunks into complete, coherent pipelines applicable in real-world contexts. This approach stitches together essential knowledge elements to guide scientists from initial data handling and tool selection, through computational processes and troubleshooting, to final analysis and result interpretation. By integrating these pieces, each pathway offers a comprehensive journey, tailored to the learner's specific needs and filling in any gaps with references to foundational topics.

The user can filter Learning Pathways by:

* ready-made pipelines, e.g., *Differential gene Expression starting from raw reads* or *UAS image processing using ODM*
* workshops, e.g., *GRWG - workshop 2022* or *Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) workshop*
* working group, e.g., **Geospatial Research**, **Pollinator Research**
* workbook, e.g., **Geospatial Earth Observations**, **Bioinformatics**
* broad category/module: e.g., `image processing`, `data management`, `data storing`, `machine learning`, `genome assembly`
* specific tag or keyword: e.g., `pandas`, `ODM`, `satellite`, `fasta`, `contig`, `qiime2`
