## Nomenclature

  * *(Spatial) Interpolation*: Using observations of dependent and
    independent variables to estimate the value of the dependent
    variable at unobserved independent variable values. For spatial
    applications, this can be the case of having point observations
    (i.e., variable observations at known x-y coordinates) and then
    predicting a gridded map of the variable (i.e., estimating the
    variable at the remaining x-y cells in the study area).
  * *Random Forest*: A supervised machine learning algorithm that 
    uses an ensemble of decision trees for regression or 
    classification.
