title: Handling Vector Data
description: This tutorial covers how to manipulate geospatial vector datasets. A dataset with polygon geometries representing wildfire perimeters is joined with a dataset with point geometries representing air quality monitoring stations to determine which stations observed unhealthy concentrations of small particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere around the time of the Camp Fire in northern CA in 2018.
