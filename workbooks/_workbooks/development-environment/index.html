In Data Science, everyone more-or-less is a developer. Whether you write simple scripts in Bash, submit jobs to a queuing system on an HPC infrastructure, or develop advanced software and web applications in any programming language, an integrated development environment (IDE) makes your daily work easier. Among useful features, there are built-in browsing of the file system, autocomplete of syntax, a preview of available attributes, error detection, customized formatting, and even source code rendering (e.g., markdown or HTML). Even if you're only using open-source pipelines, it's worth familiarizing yourself with common editors such as Atom or Jupyter to get the most out of them.
