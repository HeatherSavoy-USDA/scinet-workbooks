- Brainstormed about frontend layout of the platform.
- Discussed some backend implementations:
  - front mater variables: `org` and `ordered`
- Discussed options for acknowledging contributions
  - where: repo, website
  - what: ideas, code, knowledge, content, etc.

- Assumed workbooks as well-structured and pre-ordered without the need of repeating a module in few workbooks. Learning Pathways will mix-and-merge elements from various workbooks.
  - Individual tutorials in workbooks contain knowledge chunks or individual analysis steps. They work as building blocks. They will include examples and exercises.
  - Learning Pathways will cover the complete pipelines using the knowledge chunks and analytical building blocks, providing the comprehensive guide from raw data to publicable results.
- Considered Working Groups section as the playground and in-progress documentation for current research (testing or building new pipelines).
    - they can serve as a solid base for creating new tutorials
    - create the habit of project documentation
    - facilitate the publication
    - increase user engagement
    - it can be a coordinated effort of the working groups and the VRSC; overtime it helps build the SCINet knowledge base and in-depth background of the SCINet research scope
    - access can be protect by login


**TODO:**
- create `_data/dev_notes` file to keep track of our development progress and ideas for exploration

- create `pages/styling.md` file to explain front matter variables and styling components (for developers and future contributors)

- update css/sass solutions to directly modify the default USWDS styles

- change backend nomenclature:
  - **workbooks** are the files in `_compiled` (including bioinformatics.md, data-science.md, geospatial.md, structure-dynamics.md, core-skills.md, environment-ecosystem.md, integrative-biology.md)
  - **modules** are all sections/categories established within each workbook; currently stored all together in `_workbooks`

- in the Workbook Finder section:
  - remove the sidebar
  - remove the "Explore the Workbook collections" component
  - fix ordering of the modules within the "Filter Workbooks" component, i.e., sort alphabetically
  - convert category tag into the button pointing to the corresponding workbook

- rearrange the main navigation bar:
  - Workbook Finder as the first tab
  - Home, Glossary and About moved above the search bar
  - move User Guides (related to SCINet infrastructure) from SCINet website into SCINet workbooks (optionally, to consider) to improve user experience, easy cross linking and make both resources more compatible

- backend:
  - check and (optionally) reimplement/simplify the ordering approach (`org`, `ordered` variables)
  - add the front matter variable with randomized value for each tutorial, serving as unique identifier (requires some more brainstorming about the best approach)
    - purpose: easy cross linking and embedding sections of tutorials within other tutorials and learning pathways
    - make this variable easily accessible from the rendered website (to facilitate referencing in user-contributed tutorials)



Note: The workbook tags and filtering are currently not functioning as intended.
 - We could implement a simple workbook tag - it would currently show as "Core", "Data Science", and "Specialization"
 - We could have it pull from the url instead of the path.  This would give us "Core", "Data Science", and the various specializations.

 - There is potenial to adjust About to make it as a single link in the secondary navigation, with multiple pages within the sidenav of that page.

 - Will begin outlines for a more robust filter for the Find a Workbook page, to facilitate increased tagging and filtration.
